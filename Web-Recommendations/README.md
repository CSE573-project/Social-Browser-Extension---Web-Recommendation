This folder contains code for Web Usage Mining, Knowledge Graph Construction, Dataset Clustering, and Web Recommendation. 

The web recommendation service is exposed as an API which in turn refers to main.py and mining.py. 

Usage: 
Send a POST request to <Application URL>/recommendation with a list of URLs in this json format:

{
    "request_links" : ["link1", "link2", "link3"]
}

This will return the web recommendations generated by our application.
